Hi there, I’m Hantao LI (李 瀚韜・リ　カントウ)! Welcome to my personal website! :)

I am currently a PhD student at the Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/index.html), supervised by Associate Professor Takuya Hiroshima. Before moving to Japan, I was a visiting student at the [Global Aqua Remote Sensing (GARS) laboratory](https://garslab.com/) at Southern University of Science and Technology, supervised by Professor Lian Feng. Additionally, I worked as a research assistant at the [Subdivision of Urban-Regional Science and Geospatial Artificial Intelligence](https://supdgeoai.wordpress.com/), School of Urban and Environmental Sciences at Peking University, under the supervision of Assistant Professor Zhaoya Gong.

My research specializes in the integration of remote sensing technologies and artificial intelligence. My work revolves around monitoring and analyzing forest structures and dynamics on various scales, from local ecosystems to national landscapes. By leveraging cutting-edge satellite images, spaceborne LiDAR, and airborne LiDAR data, combined with advanced machine learning /deep learning models, I aim to provide high-precision 3D data that supports effective forest management.

In addition, I am deeply concerned with the impacts of climate change on forest disturbances and the assessment of forest resilience in the face of natural disasters. I strive to bridge the gap between complex data and actionable insights to support sustainable forest management and inform climate action strategies.
