Hi there, I’m Hantao LI (李 瀚韜・リ　カントウ)! Welcome to my personal website! :)

I am currently a PhD student at the Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/index.html), supervised by Associate Professor Takuya Hiroshima. Before moving to Japan, I was a visiting student at the [Global Aqua Remote Sensing (GARS) laboratory](https://garslab.com/) at Southern University of Science and Technology, supervised by Professor Lian Feng. Additionally, I worked as a research assistant at the [Subdivision of Urban-Regional Science and Geospatial Artificial Intelligence](https://supdgeoai.wordpress.com/), School of Urban and Environmental Sciences at Peking University, under the supervision of Assistant Professor Zhaoya Gong.

My research specializes in the integration of remote sensing technologies and artificial intelligence. My work revolves around monitoring and analyzing forest structures and dynamics on various scales, from local ecosystems to national landscapes. By leveraging cutting-edge satellite images, spaceborne LiDAR, and airborne LiDAR data, combined with advanced machine learning /deep learning models, I aim to provide high-precision 3D data that supports effective forest management.

In addition, I am deeply concerned with the impacts of climate change on forest disturbances and the assessment of forest resilience in the face of natural disasters. I strive to bridge the gap between complex data and actionable insights to support sustainable forest management and inform climate action strategies.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
